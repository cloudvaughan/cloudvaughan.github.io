<h1>We need to give AWS Amplify a fighting chance</h1>
vaughan mason - 2021-05-18
<p>So going through the process of creating a static website on AWS</p>

<p>We are sitting in a bit of a waiting game with the SSL and the domain verification, it was a lot simpler on Azure for a third-party website verifications.
<img src="/assets/images/posts/awsWaiting.png" alt="awsWaiting" /> So I may have done this wrong, it was a little confusing as AWS determines ownership first before it does DNS activation. Actually having to read the documentation to get this one right. The thing is when I did this step on Azure, it was simple and straight forward. If this does not work I am giving up
 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-a-third-party-dns-provider.html">Documentation DNS Verification</a> Crazy not simply</p>

<p>So I partially blame myself and AWS, their documentation was not fully aligned to what need to be done.</p>

<p>It is working now, and must have recreated the dns settings on website a couple of times. Editing DNS records is a dark art.</p>

<p>Going to complete the build process whilst we wait. Okay that has been done. This is a little ridiculous.</p>

<p>Verifications has gone over 15 mins, Azure site was up by now.</p>
