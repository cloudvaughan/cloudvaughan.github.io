For me this is a daily task, that involves browsing a collections of blogs/websites, listen to a collection of podcasts and then doing technical training. I’m sharing a few below and will update, please share more with me on twitter @cloudvaughan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Training
A Cloud Guru
Great platform, a lot of focus on AWS but the content for Microsoft and Google is growing. It using a subscription model but is very reasonable as you get access to a ton of content.
Microsoft Learning Docs
This a free platform offered by Microsoft, great as you can search for content based on roles. You earn badges and can track you status if you log in. Works great with the Azure Sandbox environment.
Microsoft Cloud Society
Cloud Society. The one-stop learning platform that helps you boost your cloud skills with a range of free courses.
AWS Training
Learn from AWS experts. Advance your skills and knowledge. Build your future in the AWS Cloud.
Podcasts
Screaming in the Cloud
This podcast is amazing, Corey Quinn unpacks a range of topics in a take no prisoners manner. He cuts through the bull and no one is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Cast
Another fantastic option. Aaron and Brian discuss the best of cloud computing from around the world. They cover a weekly update of cloud news of the week and then take you through specific topics with industry experts.&lt;/p&gt;
