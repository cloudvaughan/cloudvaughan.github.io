<ul>
  <li>Good morning, my name is Vaughan Mason and I’ll be speaking about the challenges of being cloud native</li>
  <li>Let me tell you a little bit about myself.
    <ul>
      <li>I have been working as part of technology deliver teams for a number of years.</li>
      <li>I have multiple certification in Cloud and Data Management and I have passion for understanding the fundamentals and growing my capability from there.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I work for a company called FNZ and our purpose is Helping people achieve their financial goals.
    <ul>
      <li>We do this by transforming the way financial companies serve their wealth management clients by providing digital personalised, high-quality and low-cost solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Providing high-quality solutions is where my role at FNZ is so exciting.
    <ul>
      <li>I’m the Head of Engineering for the Transfer Agency Business in South Africa.</li>
      <li>As the Head of Engineering I’m responsible for building a world class software engineering capability within FNZ.</li>
      <li>We are focused on continuously improving the way that developers work and providing a supportive environment that is focused on continuous improvement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why is this important.
    <ul>
      <li>If we look at the research that highlighted in the book</li>

<h3 id="what-is-cloud-native">What is Cloud Native</h3>

<p>So to describe what cloud native is I’m going to use the definition from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation which falls under the umbrella of the Linux foundation.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md">CNCF Cloud Native Definition</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to be cloud native you environment need to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Loosely coupled</li>
  <li>Scalable</li>
  <li>Resilient</li>
  <li>Manageable and Observable</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-are-organizations-adopting-cloud-native">Why are organizations adopting cloud native</h4>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UGewu4MMYZobunfKr5sOGXsspcLOH_5XeCLyOHKh9LU/edit#slide=id.gc98d72cd14_1_1621">Why Cloud Native according to the CNCF</a></p>

<p>One of the benefits that catches my eye is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Cloud native infrastructure enables higher development velocity – improving your services faster – with lower risk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any organization that develops software, which is most companies, will be attracted to this benefit.
BUT when you look at the cloud native landscape you begin to understand that it is easier said then done.</p>

<h4 id="cloud-native-landscape">Cloud Native Landscape</h4>

<p>Let’s have a look at the cloud native landscape</p>

<p><a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Landscape</a></p>

<p>As we can see we are spoilt for choice with cloud native technologies and the question is how do you control this in your environments.</p>

<p>Can you quantify developers impact on your business? By the technology choices that they make.</p>

<h3 id="why-developers-are-key">Why developers are key</h3>

<p>As most companies are becoming software companies. They count on the people developing software to make the right technologies chooses. Developer have been coined as the new kingmakers.
You need to rely on the people using the technology, once coined the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Kingmakers-Developers-Conquered-World-ebook/dp/B0097E4MEU">king makers</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud skill shortage
    <ul>
      <li>There have been a number of articles and posts over the year about cloud skills shortage.</li>
      <li>A recent survey by HashiCorp, State of Cloud Strategy, has highlighted that 57% of their respondents say skills shortage is a top cloud challenge.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/state-of-the-cloud">Hashicorp state of Cloud</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For me, I believe certifications are a great way to address this.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://go.acloudguru.com/rs/194-UHP-609/images/ebook_value_of_certs.pdf">ebookValueCerts</a></li>
      <li>ACloudGuru a leading cloud training platform has cited that certification help get everyone onto the same page. By ensuring that all employees are working off the same base knowledge.</li>
      <li>A Global Knowledge 2019 IT Skills and Salary report says that IT professionals, overwhelmingly report better job effectiveness after achieving a new certificaitons.</li>
      <li>Here are a few of the numbers they reported from job effectivenes.</li>
      <li>In the same report it was highlighted that certified employees add value to an organisation.</li>
      <li>Personally I have completed a number of certifications and have found them extremely valuable. On any particular topic they expose you to information that is invaluable to the success of working with technology.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If we look back at the Accelerate research and focus on the activities that contribute to job satisfaction which in turn contributes to organisational performance.
    <ul>
      <li>These are all things that also contribute to the success of working in the Cloud.</li>
      <li>Deployment pain of software is negatively correlated with job satisfaction, the harder it is to deploy a piece of software the lower the developer morale.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="are-your-teams-designed-for-success">Are your teams designed for success</h4>

<p>According to Conway’s Law</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organisation’s communication structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Here is a graphical representation of that.</li>
  <li>So if an organisation is looking to produce a microservices styled application then it needs to ensure that the teams are structured in a way that supports this.</li>
  <li>A great book that unpacks the concept of team structures is Team Topologies.</li>
  <li>Again the concept here is that you need to design for success and not hope that it happens.</li>
</ul>

So to be cloud native you environment need to be: Loosely coupled Scalable Resilient Manageable and Observable Why are organizations adopting cloud native Why Cloud Native according to the CNCF One of the benefits that catches my eye is: Cloud native infrastructure enables higher development velocity – improving your services faster – with lower risk Cloud Native Landscape Let’s have a look at the cloud native landscape Cloud Native Landscape The New Kingmakers Why developers are key Cloud Skill Gap Hashicorp State of Cloud Strategy Certifications Are your teams designed for success]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lots of reading</title><link href="https://tech.nosam.co.za//tech/2021/08/18/LinksToRead.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lots of reading" /><published>2021-08-18T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-08-18T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://tech.nosam.co.za//tech/2021/08/18/LinksToRead</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tech.nosam.co.za//tech/2021/08/18/LinksToRead.html"><![CDATA[<ul>

  <li>I was born on a Monday and 13000 day was a Monday</li>
  <li>Seems like Monday has to be ahead, 1858 Mondays and only 1857 rest of the days. (Makes sense based on above)</li>

So obviously, I have been doing the same. With most things in life, automation, the more frequently and the smallest detail you meaure, the more accurate your decision making process will be. So I want to see if I could autmate the process of collecting these stats. Will not be covering how to show them visually besides stored in a log file.</p>

<h2 id="speedtest">Speedtest</h2>

<p>So I’m not going to going to try of rebuilding something that is readily available. <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">speedtest.net</a>, has a great website for you to track you upload and download speeds. Depending on your ISP, they will usually accept these results with the slight exception that you have to remove all devices off the network (You can refer to my other post on networking, I would provide a link but have not gotten that fully working yet). Great thing about Speedtest, is that they now offer a CLI (Command Line Interface).</p>

<p>Time to install:</p>

<h3 id="installing-cli">Installing CLI</h3>

<p>Depending on your OS, you can follow the information <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli">here</a>.</p>

<p>I did the following:</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>curl <span class="nt">-s</span> https://install.speedtest.net/app/cli/install.deb.sh | <span class="nb">sudo </span>bash
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>speedtest
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then to check your speed your just type</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>speedtest
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Results</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>   Speedtest by Ookla

     Server: xxxxxxxx
        ISP: xxxxxxxx
    Latency:     1.40 ms   (0.07 ms jitter)
   Download:   252.52 Mbps (data used: 123.3 MB)
     Upload:    88.74 Mbps (data used: 44.6 MB)
Packet Loss:     0.0%
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But now we need to automate this process….</p>

<h3 id="automation-is-king">Automation is king</h3>

<p>So as I am using a RaspberryPi (read Linux), I will be using a shell file and crontab to automate this process.</p>

<p>Few things that I learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speedtest does not want you to automate

      <li>Bit of a half truth, as they just need you to confirm that you are using this for personal use. Which I am.</li>
      <li>If you add the following argument, –accept-license, it works.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As I am still learning Linux, the folder structures, file locations and privileges took me a few minutes (read hour) to master.
    <ul>
      <li>Most of the time this goes to the root of the user that you logged in as.</li>
      <li>I went with the approach of a file per day, so make sure you append instead of over writting if you want to follow this approach (» over &gt;).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So I created a sh file, scheduled it with crontab and we are away.</p>

<p>Here is the basic script for the sh file update the user details</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When developing apps in the cloud, you need to understand latency and network speed. If you go for a cheaper region, you need to be sure you meeting the technical specifications of your applications (think timeouts).</li>
  <li>Being cloud native means understanding what that cloud is built on. So that is why I am experimenting and continuing to learn in this environment.</li>

<p>We are sitting in a bit of a waiting game with the SSL and the domain verification, it was a lot simpler on Azure for a third-party website verifications.
<img src="/assets/images/posts/awsWaiting.png" alt="awsWaiting" /> So I may have done this wrong, it was a little confusing as AWS determines ownership first before it does DNS activation. Actually having to read the documentation to get this one right. The thing is when I did this step on Azure, it was simple and straight forward. If this does not work I am giving up
 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-a-third-party-dns-provider.html">Documentation DNS Verification</a> Crazy not simply</p>

<p>So I partially blame myself and AWS, their documentation was not fully aligned to what need to be done.</p>

<p>It is working now, and must have recreated the dns settings on website a couple of times. Editing DNS records is a dark art.</p>

<p>Going to complete the build process whilst we wait. Okay that has been done. This is a little ridiculous.</p>

<p>Verifications has gone over 15 mins, Azure site was up by now.</p>]]></content><author><name>vaughan mason</name></author><category term="tech" /><category term="cloud" /><category term="aws" /><category term="cloud" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So going through the process of creating a static website on AWS]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">WHAT Azure has Static Web Apps now!</title><link href="https://tech.nosam.co.za//tech/cloud/2021/05/17/azureTech.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="WHAT Azure has Static Web Apps now!" /><published>2021-05-17T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-05-17T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://tech.nosam.co.za//tech/cloud/2021/05/17/azureTech</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tech.nosam.co.za//tech/cloud/2021/05/17/azureTech.html"><![CDATA[<p>Found out that I could host this website on Azure using Azure Static Apps.

Azure Static Apps went GA
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/develop-production-scale-modern-web-apps-quickly-with-azure-static-web-apps/">Announcement</a></p>

<p>Read a bit of the documentation and realised that I can build my website to both GitHub Pages and Azure pages at the same time. I’m then going to allow users to context switch because why not.</p>

<h2 id="got-it-running-in-5-mins">Got it running in 5 mins</h2>

<p>I did do a lot of reading and stuff but I got this website hosted and running in 5 mins</p>

<h2 id="lets-get-this-website-published">Let’s get this website published</h2>

<p>I’ll be back…..</p>

<p>Only thing I needed to change in the config yml file was the destintation path. Will now be updating the deployment.sh file. Going to just create a duplicate.</p>

<p>Okay it works website is hosted at <a href="azuretech.nosam.co.za">azuretech.nosam.co.za</a></p>

<p>Website is now a complete replica of GitHub Pages. Basically which I will expand on later, the same source code is getting used to populate both sites.</p>
